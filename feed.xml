        <title>You're invited to Broncobots Kickoff, INFINITE RECHARGE</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s almost kickoff time! January 4, FIRST will be unveiling their new game, Infinite Recharge. We will be having a pancake breakfast and blind auction starting at 8 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means new challenges, new opportunities, and new ideas. We will start this year with our annual pancake breakfast at Lee’s Summit North High School. During the Pancake Breakfast, the Broadcast from FIRST will live streamed in the Performing Arts Center. This is where we will learn the details for our new game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the breakfast, the Broncobots will clean up the area, and braintstorm 11am to 5pm about the new game. We will set the ground rules, and the Broncobots will choose what our robot will do. On Day one, we will decide the “what” parts of our robot. We will brainstorm everything a team could do to be successful and use these ideas to develop a definition of what our robot should be able to do. We will also take note of every idea that our robot should be able to accomplish. We will continue to expand on our ideas on day two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day Two we will “charge” into the gritty details of what the Broncobot robot should accomplish. We will split into three different robot design groups, and one group dedicated to game strategy. This group will ultimately decide a critical role in our gameplay of Infinite Recharge, as well as a definite design decision that would affect the other design teams. The other three groups brainstorming their design ideas for climbing strategies, hatch panel placement, and cargo storage, as well as the design decision of the starting platform. After about three hours of discussion, each design sub-team will present their ideas to the entire team and make robot design decisions. We will then bring these ideas into the shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward and are excited for the upcoming season! Weekly Updates will be made to our website recapping our season, so check back here for Blog Posts and Pictures!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Broncobots : Open House</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Lee’s Summit Robotics Open House will be Sunday, Febuary 10th, opening our shop to all of Lee’s Summit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Shop is at 7th and Browning, in “Robotics 2”, behind the building inside of the parking lot. It is the first shop next to the Athletics Building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other shops will be marked so you can see the other Lee’s Summit teams shops too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open House will run from 2-4pm, and you can get a good look at our progress on the season!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Build Season : Week One Summary</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We start off our prototyping and brainstorming for the Destination : Deep Space game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week One started off with our Destination : Deep Space game reveal, and Two day collaboration period. We have a blog post about that on our website that you should go check out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we got settled in the shop, we went off brainstorming prototypes for the game piece collection. This went into separate groups for each game piece. We make our prototypes out of materials around the shop, which is a great learning experience for learning to brainstorm ideas and using our tools around the shop. We take these prototypes to the mentors and other team members to critique the ideas and decide on some final strategy ideas that reflect our chassis, collection of game pieces, and speed of our robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we decide our final robot design ideas, we head to the CAD programs and start prototyping parts of our robot. This process brought us into Week Two, where we plan to take those CAD prototypes into reality, and start piecing together our robot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend had some blizzard conditions, but we pushed through and worked through the snowstorm. After some power difficulties, we called it a night on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the fine details are being left out until we are ready to reveal our robot.&lt;/p&gt;
